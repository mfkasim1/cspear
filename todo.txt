shape
array:
  * sort, argsort, argmin, argmax
  * static error if inplace math op applied to array of non-real
  * matmul
  * strided views (negative stride, i.e. flip)
  * fancy indexing
  * transpose views
  * casting
  * automatically generate lib method and array method in one typing

test:

SIMD:
  * vector int
  * partial load with default value (to use in reduce)

optimize:
* optimize filter view (not constructing the indices until it is necessary)
* save a contiguous copy for non-contiguous view
* SIMD!
