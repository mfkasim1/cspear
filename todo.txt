shape
array:
  * using smart pointer for dataptr to handle cases like:
      auto b = arr.copy().at(0);
  * static error if inplace math op applied to array of non-real
  * matmul
  * strided views (negative stride, i.e. flip)
  * indexed views
  * transpose views
  * casting

test:

SIMD:
  * vector int
  * partial load with default value (to use in reduce)

optimize:
* optimize filter view (not constructing the indices until it is necessary)
* save a contiguous copy for non-contiguous view
* SIMD!
