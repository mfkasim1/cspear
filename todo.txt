shape
array:
  * matmul
  * strided views
  * indexed views
  * transpose views
  * casting

test:
  * contiguous view array with int

SIMD:
  * vector int
  * partial load with default value (to use in reduce)

optimize:
* optimize filter view (not constructing the indices until it is necessary)
* save a contiguous copy for non-contiguous view
* SIMD!
